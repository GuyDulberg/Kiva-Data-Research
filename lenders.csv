israel6486,Israel,2251220,Neptune,NJ,US,1467948642,www.isrealdeep.com,Business Consultant,I believe in the power of entrepreneurship to change lives.,"I was born in Portland, OR & spent my pre-adolescent years San Diego, CA, two of America\'s most desirable cities, yet, my story is one filled with adversity, lack, and hunger. Proper food and clothing were, literally, luxuries to me as a child, constantly out of my reach. Since I was 5 I wanted to work; every problem I had seemed to be connected to my mother\'s income and her choice to work. The powerlessness that I felt watching my neighbors on welfare have more than us drives me still.\n\nThough labeled ""gifted"" academically as a child (reading at a college level at 8 years old) I was also labeled ""behaviorally challenged"" due to an inability to sit still and be quiet in class. Entrepreneurship was a beacon of hope that sustained me in the lowest moments of my life. While my peers idolized athletes, musicians, and film stars; I followed the decisions of Richard Branson, Larry Ellison, Warren Buffet, Steve Jobs, and the like. After-school, I\'d ""go to work"" the same traits that my teachers complained about were exactly what my customers raved about. My ability to speak and inability to ""sit still"" have been vital to my success as an entrepreneur and consultant. \n\nMy passions are Business, Education, the Arts, and Technology, in that order. My purpose is to leverage those passions to change the economic outlook & outcomes of people in disadvantaged communities. I believe in the power of startups to change the world and have dedicated my life to promoting entrepreneurship because I understand it\'s importance in creating safer, stronger, communities and families. I currently reside on the Jersey Shore collecting data, creating courses, and developing applications that will open-source income for the masses as we move from a task-based to a talent-based economy.",,,0,Business

Now, I'm proud to be living my dream of offering women affordable access to practical courses and mentoring for small business development. I love collaborating with other local and international partners to provide support and guidance for women! My background in curriculum development, instructional strategy, technical assistance, and writing has come to serve Strategic Achievement very well.",1,,0,Business

What you need to do is get inside a Knockerball, which is a great big inflatable ball that covers your head and upper body while keeping your legs free. It wraps around you, instead of going over your head, so you will still be able to breathe normally. Once inside it, you can flip, roll, and knock yourself into friends without experiencing any pain. The ball is so wide that even if you do fall, it will stop your legs from hitting the ground with a hard impact.",,,0,Buyers

Although I need funds myself to help inventory my business and get us up off the ground, I give to be able to help others achieve their dreams!","The Story Behind Baby Cotton Boutique\n\nYears ago, I came up with the concept of Baby Cotton Boutique after being infertile, I loved buying baby clothing and always wanted to make my own, the fact that I was infertile after having my first child, when I wanted nothing more but to have another drew me closer to the idea of selling baby clothing and items. I was obsessed with all things baby. At the time, I came up with the idea I was not able to pursue it. This has been a dream of mine for 6 years now. I began researching clothing, business taxes, wholesalers, etc. I started small and decided to make this into Direct Sales to bring the sales to me and to advertise for me while also helping others, mainly stay at home moms. Everyone loves baby clothes, right?! After I had my miracle baby, my daughter born in April 2017 I decided it was time to start up the business. I then started applying for tax IDs and so forth and getting everything patented and set in place. I then decided to make sure we ג€go greenג€ because I know a lot of babies have allergies and reactions to all these harsh chemicals and I wanted to make sure our items were safe for all babies and children.

I was born in Ornlongkranh village, Kompong Thom province. In the late seventies the Khmer Rouge occupied our village and systematically killed or removed the families to take over their properties. Because the Khmer Rouge targeted the educated people in particular, Cambodia lost a whole generation of skilled teachers and doctors.\n\nMy father was killed when I was 4 years old, leaving my mother to raise me and my sisters on our small family farm. I was sick most of the time, as we had little food and clean water and more work than we could handle. I studied only the basics when I could. At this point, my family needed me to tend our cows, I was the only boy and my job as herder was the priority. I knew education was important, but had little choice.\nMy mother decided to remarry and left my sisters and me with my grandparents. I asked her to join the monks, as my friends that had gone could read and write, while I could not. I asked my family for money to go to the city to continue my studies, but got none.\n\nFinally, my mother could sell a section of our land for US$15. I used this money to go Battambong to study. After I learnt to speak English, I began teaching Siem Reapג€™s poorest children who could not afford school.\n\nI began with just a few benches, one map and one whiteboard, in my hut in at Angkor Sa Pagoda. Six boys came to the pagoda to live and study. Many more started attending my classes. We survived on donations and the money I received from offering prayers to the town people. The school grew so big that I had to look for another location. Now we are in the process of building our new school on the premises of the LHCCO in Siem Reap.",,,0,Charitys

lifecyclecarmel,LifeCycle Carmel,2172210,Carmel,IN,US,1462369378,www.LifeCycleCarmel.com,LifeCoach|Sports Psychologist,"Business start-up and development.  Or perhaps more appropriately ""life development"".  I am evolving my experience as a coach/sports psychologist to create a unique and mainstream counseling method on two wheels.  Instead of the dark, intimidating therapist office, I am engaging the welcoming and refreshing outdoors to inspire and help people grow on two wheels.  Fitness and activity is a scientifically proven benefit to many emotional and mental illnesses due to the benefits of activity on body chemistry.  My engaging an ""active"" counselling method, I am encouraging and reinforcing a positive lifestyle and more likely sustained personal development.  I am launching LifeCycle at the encouragement of others as I grow out of financial challenges caused by the selfish and ignorant greed of others.  I simply don\'t have the reserves or resources to do this from my own bank account at the moment... but that doesn\'t make is less significant - particularly to those who will benefit.  I am blessed to be a gifted coach.  The skills is takes to truly engage and inspire others can\'t be taught in a classroom, it is simply in one\'s DNA.  LifeCycle Carmel is truly unique.  Already in place are effective partnerships with Fitbit activity trackers, Bianchi bicycles, and Hammer Nutrition - all of which support the core values of the business, and support the efforts and commitment of LifeCycle Carmel clients.  My mission is simply summarized as this:  INSPIRE | CHALLENGE | SUCCEED!","I am a former professional/elite cyclist, and an active coach/lifecoach.  LifeCycle Carmel is effectively bringing together both of my talents and passions into a business that is about the very basic aspiration of people to ""be happy"" and feel good about themselves.  My athletic experience means nothing... LifeCycle Carmel isn\'t a race or a team.  It is about my clients\' journey of personal discovery.  I believe that in order to be a truly successful coach, you have to be leader, and care more about the success of others than yourself.  It is a philosophy that runs counter to the ""culture of selfishness"" and individualism so prevalent in our society today.  But I also believe it is why I am successful as a coach... I am authentically and humbly connecting with people in a way that is real.  Something very much and unfortunately missing in people\'s lives today - authentic relationships.  LifeCycle Carmel is very much about helping people find balance within, because that is the ONLY way to true and sustaining peace and happiness in life.  And what better way that a relaxing bike ride to do it?",,,0,Coachings

prestamosrapidos,creditos,2390421,,,ES,1481731223,www.creditosrapidos10min.com,Comparador de crֳ©ditos rֳ¡pidos,"Ofrecemos todo tipo de crֳ©ditos rֳ¡pidos, microprֳ©stamos online, tarjetas de crֳ©dito y prֳ©stamos urgentes para conseguir dinero rֳ¡pido en 10 minutos sin aval y sin nֳ³mina. Ademֳ¡s, disponemos de prֳ©stamos con ASNEF o rAI.","El pago de sus prֳ©stamos rֳ¡pidos reduce rֳ¡pidamente su deuda mensual, libera mֳ¡s dinero para usted y su familia, y ayuda a ser elegible para otros prֳ©stamos. En pocas palabras, menos deuda que usted tiene, mֳ¡s el dinero que tiene en su bolsillo. El pago de prֳ©stamos rֳ¡pidamente requiere de una planificaciֳ³n y determinaciֳ³n. Aquֳ­ hay algunos pasos a seguir para el pago de sus prֳ©stamos rֳ¡pidamente y conseguir que usted y su familia libre de deudas.\n\n1.)  Asegֳ÷rese de que no hay ninguna penalizaciֳ³n por pago anticipado: Algunos prestamistas le cobrarֳ¡ una penalizaciֳ³n por el pago de un prֳ©stamo antes de tiempo. Lo mejor es llamar con antelaciֳ³n para averiguar si se le cobrarֳ¡ mֳ¡s por el pago de su prֳ©stamo antes de lo previsto.\n\n2.)  Establecer un presupuesto: Despuֳ©s de haber descubierto que puede pagar su prֳ©stamo antes de tiempo, el siguiente paso debe ser la creaciֳ³n de un presupuesto mensual para su hogar. Este es un factor clave para determinar exactamente cuֳ¡nto puede permitirse el lujo de pagar cada mes y todavֳ­a tienen suficiente dinero para cubrir el resto de sus gastos.\n\n3.)  Crear un plan de pago de la deuda: Ahora que ya sabe el pago mensual que puede pagar, determinar un marco de tiempo realista para pagar el prֳ©stamo en su totalidad. Usted puede encontrar que puede que no tenga al mֳ¡ximo fuera de su presupuesto para cumplir con su objetivo!\n\n4.)  Los gastos de corte: Al configurar el presupuesto de su familia, es fֳ¡cil centrarse en los pagos mensuales regulares e ignorar otros gastos, tales como comer fuera, cortes de pelo, y tiendas de comestibles. La forma mֳ¡s fֳ¡cil de liberar efectivo adicional es eliminar o al menos reducir sus gastos: saltar comer fuera, recortar cupones, cortar o reducir los costosos paquetes de cable y telֳ©fono celular.\n\n5.)  Establecer un calendario de amortizaciֳ³n: Ahora que se ha cortado algunos de sus gastos y crear un plan de pago de la deuda, es el momento de crear su calendario de amortizaciֳ³n. Configuraciֳ³n de la programaciֳ³n es la parte fֳ¡cil; le toca a usted para mantener el plan de cada mes para asegurarse de que llegue a su objetivo de convertirse en libre de deuda.\n\n6.)  Automatizar los pagos de la deuda: Es fֳ¡cil dejar un resguardo de pago a travֳ©s de las grietas. Afortunadamente, muchos prestamistas han automatizado los planes de pago en las que su pago mensual puede ser retirada automֳ¡ticamente de su cuenta corriente o cuenta de ahorros. En algunos casos, como con los prֳ©stamos rֳ¡pidos, la configuraciֳ³n de pagos automֳ¡ticos en realidad puede reducir su tasa de interֳ©s.\n\n7.)  Seguir con su plan: la creaciֳ³n de un presupuesto, la reducciֳ³n de gastos, y la creaciֳ³n de un calendario de amortizaciֳ³n son pasos importantes hacia la reducciֳ³n de su deuda. Con el fin de asegurarse de que estֳ¡ alcanzando su objetivo de ser libre de deuda, que necesita para cumplir con su plan cada mes. Asegֳ÷rese de que no estֳ¡ dejando que los gastos innecesarios se arrastran de nuevo en su presupuesto, y estar al tanto de sus pagos mensuales. Si bien puede parecer como un montֳ³n de trabajo ahora, el resultado final le darֳ¡ la paz de la mente para el futuro.",,,0,Comparadors

I have always had to keep busy with my hands and love to design and play until I get the result I am looking for. I love tools. Not so much those that are found in craft stores but more like the tools I played with as a child in my Papaג€™s basement workshop. I like the big industrial tools. If it has a pink handle I probably donג€™t own it. Early I figured out I could sell what I made - as an 11 year old the entrepreneurial spirit burned in me. I was sent to the principalג€™s office for selling fuzzy inch worms for a quarter (5 for $1, if youג€™re interested). Like Gonzo out of a cannon, I was off like a shot and selling various wares. As an adult I have had the honor and pleasure of raising two children to adulthood making and selling products both retail and wholesale. I did this as a single parent and with no debt. It was a matter of making ends meet during those years. My singular focus was being there for the kids and being a part of their lives. Now that they are grown it is time to grow my business.

My parents along with my 9 siblings migrated to the United States in the mid 1960s when I was about 4 years old. In college I majored in engineering. I spend 22 years working for Raytheon and IBM. I have 3 wonderful sons. I love to travel especially to indigenous areas (off the beaten path) and speaking to older people because the majority of then arenג€™t caught up in the need for lots of material things. Happiness to them comes from nature, loving and respecting each other and appreciating the creatorג€™s gift to us. Iג€™m a minimalist. My friends and family are in awe that Iג€™ve lived most of my adult life without owning a TV. Iג€™m an avid reader. I get up everyday at 5AM and read a number of publications (yes, I have internet service). Although I love science and engineering, I feel Iג€™ve found my calling as a bee farmer. I get a lot of energy and inspiration when Iג€™m tending to my bees. I especially love to educate my customers on my honey-derived products. Being an entrepreneur is challenging at times. My demand is greater than my supply because of lack of funding. The love for my products is what drives me, but my sleepless nights are due to the fear I have that I will not be able to keep up with demand.",2,,6,Engineers

People of different countries with different languages have learnt the techniques from this video techniques course and could improve a lot. In my Superior Singing Method review I tried to focus the effectiveness of this program. Buy Superior Singing Method to improve your singing quality.\n\nAccording to Aaron Anastasi people are not born with natural talent. Learning singing is just learning any other physical activities. If you learn with proper proposition, principle and techniques you can achieve your goal. You might have some pretty embarrassing moments early on but regular practice, the proper methods and training can bring radical changes to  peopleג€™s voices. The free singing lesson cannot improve your vocal gradually like the best Superior Singing Method. This is a step by step program that can improve your singing capability in 60 days.

So this singing lesson online program will help you to improve your vocal tone, vocal pitch, vocal agility, advanced vocal strength.

These are given below:\n\nDistinctive vocal work out and learning how to sing.\nBreathing techniques and diaphragm breathing that is control the thorax.\nControlling vocal tone for online singing.\nTone adjustment ability\nIncrease depth of singing power.\nAbility to bring diversity in the voice and maintaining highness/lowness of tone.\nIncrease vocal speed by using singing lessons.\n Power improvement in advanced vocal techniques.\nMr. Aaron Anastasi also included two extra modules in the best Superior Singing Method such as drama and music marketing. Along with these modules the singing lessons online for beginners course includes 50 HD Video lessons, daily vocal exercises and more than 30 advanced work outs for your vocals. This information is also written in other Superior Singing Method reviews.\n\nThe Benefits of the Superior Singing Methods:\n\nThe extreme popularity of this Superior Singing Method indicates that people are becoming highly benefited by following these methods. This voice lessons on line is becoming popular for various reasons. In my Superior Singing Method review the following benefits are obvious to write.\n\nFirstly, it is a vocal coach and totally different from the traditional learning method.\nSecondly, you can watch it repeatedly in case of difficulties as it is a singing lessons for beginners.\nThirdly, the download system of this on line voice lessons allows you to work on your voice any time.\nFourthly it is different from the free on line singing lessons.

They perform as a professional singer in front of public. So these vocal lessons on line will not make you only a perfect singer but also builds you as a professional performance.\nBesides these advantages there is another important reason for its popularity. This video based singing lesson program is convenient for people who do not have enough time to go any training centre. They can practice at home at their convenient time. They can maintain the time schedule between working time and learning method.\n\nWhy to follow the Best Superior Singing Methods to learn to sing online?\n\nThe best Superior Singing Method is designed actually for the beginners.  The free voice lessons available online are not as much effective as the best Superior Singing Method. Aaron has been split up his best Super Singing Method to a number of modules.  This singing course is also a music lessons for kids. If you give enough time it will help you to learn the saxophone lessons. In my Superior Singing Method review I must say that you do not need to go any other singing schools or singing teachers. You might think that to learn singing methods more efficiently you might need one tutor or attend in singing classes. You may hire some Grammy winning singer to coach you but it may cause a huge expense and time consuming. A traditional coach, who can teach you violin lessons in person but you, may not have enough time to sit with him maintaining his time schedule. Again it may not possible for you to visit them every day in a week. Your goal is to improve your voice, you need to sing lessons and practice constantly.\n\n\nSo before going to the singing coach please watch Aaronג€™s online vocal exercises to learn the singing method step by step. Also research other Superior Singing Method reviews to justify. Aaron has developed the best superior singing method targeting the beginners and intermediates levels. These persons include who want to get better in singing and have not born with a natural singing talent. His goal of this singing training is to make singing proficiently within 8 weeks through his singing tips course. It is a super online based singing course.\n\nAaronג€™s free vocal lessons will give you all the techniques that you need to be a perfect singer. It is a complete online training program that consists of video lessons.  It will work as a personal vocal instructor showing you how to sing well. The full video course is created on HD method so that you can watch clearly and study again and again.  This is a step by step program like a singing lesson for kids where you can learn all the aspects of online singing lessons at the right time.\n\nAccording to Aaron the best Superior singing method trains to improve your inner singing ability with amazing power to control your voice.

You can achieve such a voice where you will sing with amazing pitch, better agility, more power, improved resonance and tone to impress your audience.\n\nWhat People is Saying about the Best Superior Singing Method-Review:better way.\n\nI have gone through a number of Superior Singing Method reviews. Most of them have shown positive views towards this Superior singing method created by Aaron Anastasi . Among them Kina from North Hollywood, CA has noticed a radical change in her voice only in 6 days of using this Superior Singing Method.  She knew how to learn to sing. She recorded her voice and found it awesome. Another reviewer Dylen from Georgia said that at the end of the course she could learn to sing a lot which was unexpected to her. She gradually found the improvement in her voice. She showed her gratitude to Aaron.\n\nFrom another Superior Singing Method review I found such a singer who was ashamed and embarrassed at the first time when he sang a song in a music competition. He did not know anything about how to sing online.  His teacher told him about his singing drawbacks and suggested to take some useful singing lessons instead of free vocal lessons online. She advised him to take the Superior Singing Method therapy. Within three weeks he found a drastic change in his voice. He followed online voice lessons free strictly and could achieve his goal. He still kept on improving his voice by practicing Superior singing Method and could learn singing in a better way.\n\nDrawbacks of the Best Superior Singing Method:\n\nThere are some drawbacks of these private singing lessons that are discussed on some Superior Singing Method Reviews by its buyer. To some who liked to buy Superior Singing Method has made comment that the instructions singing exercises are not clearly written. Some other emphasized on difficulties to understand the singing techniques. But this is a matter of practice and devotion to learn it.\n\nYou are attending a virtual singing school. There is no singing teacher as well as voice trainer in front of you. It is a vocal training online course where everything is clearly given. Just you must have sense how to improve your singing voice. You will get 24 hours singing coach and vocal teacher. The more you watch and practice, the more voice training lesson will be easier to you. It does not work as a magic trick that will make you a world class singer 2/3 days. You need to be enough trained up from singing lesson online and attending singing program to be a perfect singer.\n\nThe other important factors that I want to write in my Superior Singing Method review are food habit and life style. You need to take enough healthy food and plenty of rest to have a nice voice. Some foods like chocolates, alcohol, and cold water have adverse effect on throat and thus voice.\n\nHow Will the Best Superior Singing Method Help You? \n\nIn the Superior Singing Method review I want to mention the following reasons that are suggested by Aaron Anastasi. \n\nBetter Vocal Control\n\nThe best Superior Singing Method will help you to learn singing online.

kate7769,Ochuko,2283015,Ughelli,Delta,NG,1471683944,,Farming,"This is the story of how and why I did not go to school. The truth is that my father was a bit educated in a modern sense, he was nevertheless a strong believer of our customs and traditions. In view of this, he did not make any plans to send me to school just because I was a female child, and in our culture, it is believe that the money spent on educating female children is a waste, since they would be married off to men who would reap all the benefits. And I was the eldest of all my father's children of two girls and five boys.\nOn the contrary, even before my immediate younger brother could come of school age, my father had pushed him to be enrolled at school. The problem was that my younger brother was often beaten up by some mischievous boys on the way to and from school. I was therefore assigned by my parents the task of safeguarding my kid brother by accompanying him to and back from school.\nOn one fateful day, the school Headmaster saw me playing in the school premises. He asked why I was not in class. I told him that I was only there to look after my little brother. Later, when the Headmaster got home, he narrated this incident to his wife. The woman then paid a surprise visit to my mother in order to prevail on her to try to persuade my father to let me enroll in school. \nAs it turned out, my father would not hear of it, stressing that I was another man's responsibility and I would soon be given out in marriage. When the woman saw how obstinate my father was about his decision not to send me to school, she opted to excuse my mum in order to talk to her woman to woman in private. As it turned out, my mum was not the problem. The headmaster's wife requested from my mother whether she could take up the responsibility of teaching me in private. But my mother refused on the ground that my father would find out if those bullies beat his dear son up again. The headmaster's wife really tried to come into the matter all to no avail, and so she advised that I should start making attempt to study on my own instead of playing. \nTo cut a long story short, I was married off against my will at the age of 15 to a man old enough to be my father. I have two little children, a boy and a girl. Everything seemed to be fine until one day, my husband suffered a stroke, lost his job, and the whole family was in dire financial circumstances.\nRight now, I need a loan in order to give my husband a befitting treatment, to cater for my little children needs for food, clothing, education and to expand my cassava farm.","I am a young woman from Nigeria.

After arriving in the United States over 30 years ago, I first began as a wedding photographerג€™s assistant after attending my first wedding in 1990. I learned how to create emotions through a lens in the 4 stages of a wedding, home, church, park, and reception. \n\n Always evolving,  my passion for shooting, lead to me enrolling into media arts by attending School Of Visual Arts where I got my degree in filmmaking in 2003.\nBy working my way through the entertainment business I gain real world  experience how to make my own short films. YES!!!, through school and life experiences, I now knew how those movies I saw as a boy were made.\n\nI created KMPearl Productions in 2004 because my passion for bring something to life and sharing with the world grew as I wrote, directed, and edited my own projects beginning in 2006. I fully realized my motivation for shooting empathy stories comes from my many years as a wedding photographer. One of the reasons audiences enjoy my stories is because of their subject matter,  dramatic and spiritualג€¦films you can experience together as a family.\n\nWhen I am not shooting a film, I would shoot for others who has need of my services. As a an independent filmmaker, one of the best tools you can have at your immediate disposal are great lenses. To rent them at times takes 2 days to ship out, and requires taking out a million dollar insurance policy. Often our company would get a call for a shoot that has to be done the next day. I would like to continue to produce great looking projects not only for myself, but for anyone by having immediate access to great quality lenses.","I am a New York-based filmmaker, photographer, writer and director with over ten years of media experience. Recently credited as the writer, director & producer of the short film ג€ In The Balanceג€ which is based on the highly controversial topic of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n\nI began my professional career working as a Data Entry Supervisor for Chase Bank and after 15 years decided to follow my spiritual and artistic passion by earning  a Bachelorג€™s of Fine Arts degree from New Yorkג€™s School of Visual Arts.

I could not keep up with a College and my work. Also, I lost my lover because I could not progress enough to support my Family life. \nThe TMJ disorder is affecting a huge number of people these days in the US and in other parts of the world too. Because of this there is now a lot of interest in this, as also in the signs of TMJ, causes and naturally the various TMJ treatment options as well. Here we will take a look at the symptoms of TMJ and how it is related to the Eagleג€™s syndrome.\nTemporomandibular joint or TMJ symptoms vary widely from minor pain in the jaw joint to intense headache, earache and tinnitus that can turn a person insane with bizarre hissing, whooshing, ringing, roaring sounds in the ear. While the primary signs of TMJ are easy to recognize, the secondary or atypical TMJ symptoms often prove deceptive and misleading. For instance, TMJ symptom causing sensitivity to light, blurred vision and pain behind the eyeball (caused due to inflammation in the tissue and ligaments lying in the vicinity of the affected joint) could mislead the medic into looking for optical disorders that include keratitis, corneal revascularization or even Fuchsג€™s dystrophy. Similar is the case with other unusual symptoms of TMJ that creates numbness in the fingers which can also happen due to multiple sclerosis, cervical spondylosis, alcoholic neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy and many other factors.\nHowever, here it is caused primarily due to misaligned bite, which in turn sets the muscles serving the jaws, shoulder, neck and face to go into transitory spasm. As a result of this, the nerves (brachial plexis) running into the hands and fingers get pinched, creating lack of sensation or tingling in the arms and the fingers.\nTMJ Disorder And The Eagleג€™s Syndrome\nHowever, when the Temporomandibular joint pain is inappropriately linked with the Stylomandibular Ligament pain that is caused due to Eagleג€™s syndrome, the picture changes abruptly. Even though the problem is somewhat similar to the temporomandibular joint pain involving the jaw joint, in the Ernest or Eagleג€™s syndrome, it is the stylohyoid ligament that actually creates the problem.\nThe styloid process consists of a bone structure at the base of the skull that is attached to ligaments and muscles linked to the throat and adjoining organs. When calcified or mineralized, it sticks into the jaw and the throat area, creating problem in swallowing. In chronic cases, turning the head causes pain and discomfort. Eagleג€™s syndrome can be a debilitating disease that leads to chronic malnutrition and loss of weight as against TMJ syndrome, which may be painful but far less distressing.\n \nEagleג€™s syndrome may also be considered a lesser significant issue in glossopharyngeal neuralgia that can turn to become a life threatening condition when coupled with cardiovascular complications. It can lead to severe weight loss and malnutrition even when it does not come with cardiac problems. In any case, Eagleג€™s syndrome (not TMJ syndrome) is considered by the medical profession as a significant etiological factor for precipitation of glossopharyngeal secondary neuralgia.\n \nHowever, for the sake of identification and analysis, Eagleג€™s syndrome may be considered as consisting of temporomandibular joint pain, pain in eyes, sensitivity in the teeth, pain in the throat region that aggravates during swallowing any food, tonsillar discomfort and symptomatic issues of stylohyoid elongations.\n \nTreatment of Eagleג€™s symptom includes intra-oral splints, pain relieving NSAIDs, physiotherapy and local anesthetic injections at the insertion of the ligament. However, there are reports that often suggest that radiofrequency thermoneurolysis can be effective in treating symptom of Eagleג€™s syndrome to some extent.\n \nEagle or Ernest syndrome therapy may also be achieved through strengthening the stylomandibular ligament with Prolotherapy since the symptoms are mostly caused due to weakness in that region. Studies reveal that Prolotherapy is a safe and effective treatment procedure for repairing ligament, tendon or cartilage damage in a natural process. In other words, it is does so by creating a placid inflammatory condition within the destabilized cartilage and ligaments and as the body heals itself through inflammation, Prolotherapy just invigorates the healing process.\n \nTMJ Cure Through TMJ Treatment\n \nIt is essential to opt for treatment to get relief from TMJ pain and the other problems that are associated with the disease. The good news is, there are many treatment options available that range from conventional remedies (drugs and surgeries), over the counter solutions (mouthguards and splints), exercises to relieve TMJ and home TMJ remedies. But the bad news is that, while many of them can provide a temporary relief, bit a permanent remedy is not possible. That is because they just treat the symptoms and not the root causes of the problem.\nI'm still taking some pills to relieve my instant pain which is not fixing my root of the problem and I became like a zombie. So, I decided to go through the surgery. Unfortunately, it's very hard to find a good surgery specialist for my problems. And it's not cheap at all. Dear people I'm begging you Please help me out to solve my very rare problems. I need to pay for the surgery around $5.500.00 to be happy again in this beautiful world. I believe in Karma: any small Donation from you will return back into your life for your goodness. \nThank you!\nAlexander Pinaev\n+1240-938-2590 cell\nalex.v.pinaev@gmail.com\n\n \nAbout Me\n\nHello, My name is Alex and I was born in Uzbekistan Tashkent.

Through providing freedom to others we all become free and connected again.,"I am a board certified Integrated Nurse Coach through the International Nurse Coaching Association (INCA) in 2014. And completed the Advanced International Nurse Coaching Program in 2015. This program was created specifically for Nurses, based on a whole person model of care that addresses the biological, psychological, social, spiritual, cultural, and environmental aspect of care. The integrative nurse coach process weaves the art and science of nurse coaching with the theory and practice of integrative nursing. \nGraduating from the University of Michigan's Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program in 2000, she realized there was more to nursing and medicine than the bedside. Over the last 16 years, she has remained in the hospital floating throughout various critical care areas. In 2007, Denise opened a Wellness & Fitness Center in Arizona based on body, mind and spirit and competed in natural body building competitions. Denise later closed her business and spent time exploring holistic nursing and helping others truly heal and move forward in their overall health care goals. In 2013, she became a certified Reiki Master and since has opened a practice in Detroit, Michigan helping clients recognize and move forward in their overall health and wellness goals. She currently practices as a critical care nurse in the hospital and teaches clinical for nursing students. \nDenise has not gone through this journey towards a healthier and more balanced life without overcoming challenges of her own: Stress induced hypothyroidism, emotional binge eating, hormone imbalance, high cholesterol, pre diabetes and adrenal fatigue. \nDenise Mann has a unique gift and passion that allows her to connect with people, meeting them right where they are, and empowering them along their journey to get to their health goals.",,Delphia,0,Integratives

We are into importation, distribution and sales of food stuffs at an affordable price. As our company were growing we invest more in creating our small shops (KIOSKS) without a emergency reserve all around the city (NIAMEY) in order to get closer to our customers. Then on 16 of September 2016 we are affected by a change in government policy which is to demolish all the building that are beside public offices and our main retail shop which was our strength listed among the shops that the government demolished without any compensation. Since then we just keep struggling with a larger stock of product, some of the product expired somewhere sold at a very low price but we are still struggling to survive. I wish I can have people who can contribute for raising a load worth of $50,000 USD which we will invest in buying a land and construct a new shop.

Although I am licensed to prescribe pharmaceuticals, I choose to save them as a last resort.  Instead, I use modalities such as nutrition, nutraceutical medicine, IV and injection therapy, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and physical medicine.  What sets a naturopathic doctor apart from a conventional medical doctor is our philosophy, which attests to the following 7 points: \n1.  Do No Harm- Use the most impactful treatment with the least invasiveness: Naturopathic Doctors use vitamins, minerals, herbs, homeopathy and nutrition as their primary treatment modalities, which are effective with few to no negative side effects.\n-Do not suppress symptoms: Symptoms serve as clues to help us find out the underlying illness. In fact, symptoms are the bodyג€™s own attempt to heal itself. For instance, if one develops a fever, that is the bodyג€™s attempt to heat itself up to kill the bad bugs (viral, bacterial or fungal). If we suppress a fever, we are allowing these bad bugs to flourish. The goal is to help the body to kill the bad bugs, so the fever can naturally subside. Of course, in dangerously high fevers, naturopathic doctors will take necessary steps to reduce fever and help kill the bugs.\n-Individualized care: There is no one size fits all in naturopathic medicine. Everyone has their own ways of healing, and their abilities and preferences are taken into consideration. Naturopathic doctors customize treatments plans specifically for each individual.\n2.  Find and Treat the Cause(s) ג€“ Although each disease has common triggers associated with it, each person has unique underlying factors contributing to their illness. Naturopathic doctors like to do the detective work to find the underlying cause (or causes). Rather than just masking the symptoms, we like to identify any obstacles to cure. When we can treat the cause, that is how lasting cure can happen.\n3.  Use the Healing Power of Nature ג€“ Our bodies are designed for healing. Using the most natural treatments to support the bodyג€™s healing helps to restore balance and vitality.\n4.  Treat the Whole Person ג€“ Naturopathic doctors treat the person, not the disease. Taking into account the unique physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual aspects of each person, we customize our treatments to fulfill the unmet needs.\n5.  Educate Patients ג€“ Our goal is to empower our patients to make informed decisions about their own health. We educate our patients about how to create and sustain vibrant health. We encourage our patients to take responsibility for their health and we advocate for them.\n6.  Prevention ג€“ Naturopathic doctors emphasize prevention by assessing risk factors, family history, genetics, and susceptibility to disease in order to prevent future illness and decline. Naturopathy strives to create a healthy world where all beings may thrive.\n7. Wellness ג€“ Through the healing work, we help our patients achieve optimal health, harmony, and vitality. Wellness is not just the absence of disease, it encompasses genuinely healthy physique, emotions, thoughts, and actions. As we nurture wellness in our patients, then, when disease arises, healing is quick and easy.",,,1,Naturopathics

There are certain human activities that can harm the whales - for instance, ships can collide with the whales and injure or kill them. Knowing where the whales are most likely to be allows us to make changes to ships' routes that can reduce the number of whale-ship collisions. For instance, in the past a fellow researcher asked captains of shipping vessels to make minor route changes that would take their ships around the areas with the most whales. Almost all captains agreed to the route changes, and this simple action is estimated to have saved a significant number of whales from injury and death.",684,Mike McGraw,3,Oceanographers

sdrss304,Screen Door Studio & Services LLC,2524123,Buckhannon,West Virginia,US,1492453535,www.screendoorstudioservice.com,Recording Studio/Lessons/Retail,I believe we can change the world. with music,"Our mission is to stimulate economics in central West Virginia by providing a place for musical artists to record their works and to better the community by reaching out to youth to find a productive way to express themselves.\xa0\nhe idea for Screen Door Recording Studios was originated in September 2015 and has since grown to have a physical location in downtown Buckhannon, West Virginia and the equipment required to create professional quality music. The founder of this organization is Shane Workman. His role as of now is to facilitate funding to get the business off the ground and to facilitate a clientele base in his local area. He boasts years of experience in playing instruments and recording and producing music.\xa0\nThough we have no investors as of yet, we are adamantly seeking financial assistance to help get us on our feet so as to be able to more efficiently run this business.\xa0\nBeing the first recording studio of its kind in Buckhannon, West Virginia, it is hard to tell how much Screen Door Recordings will grow over the course of time. However, the town of Buckhannon hosts an array of musical acts without the means to piece together a professionally recorded product. This will give us a steady clientele basis with no competition established, so we expect to grow at an accelerated rate once satisfied clients spread the word and share their product with those around them.\xa0\nScreen Door Recording Studios is our trade name and we are a Limited Liability Corporation. Our full LLC name is Screen Door Studio & Services LLC. Primarily we are a recording studio located in downtown Buckhannon, WV and our customer base will consist of musical artists and bands in Buckhannon and other parts of central West Virginia. While this is our target demographic we will keep an open mind to expansion of our clientele base and will treat customers from other regions to the same quality products and services.\nCurrently there is no recording studio in the downtown Buckhannon area that offers high quality audio recording and mastering. This serves as a competitive advantage and helps us to aid customer needs that are not being currently met in the area. Another advantage is the years of experience the co- founders have with playing and producing music. Being a unique business in the area, we will be able to easily tap into our target demographic and establish a customer loyalty base with ease.\nOur target market is that of musical bands and artists located in central West Virginia. Buckhannon in itself boasts an array of musically talented bands and artists, many of which do not have the equipment necessary to record their works. We aim to tap into this currently unused resource to generate revenue and expand business. We aim to get our start helping grass roots artists record their works and utilizing social media as well as more traditional outlets such as word of mouth and distribution of the artistsג€™music to not only promote the performers but to expand our name as well.\nWe believe that we can gain the vast majority of the market share with ease in that no other professional recording studio exists in the city limits of Buckhannon. Though this town is small in size, artistry resonates throughout it at a high frequency and we believe that having access to a conveniently located studio will stimulate more artistry in the community. Even more into this approach, offering lessons in music theory will help these prospective new artists hone their skills to create quality pieces of musical expression.\nOur market penetration strategy begins by recording and mastering tracks for a select handful of artists of different genres and promoting the finished products through social media. This should prove effective as it demonstrates the array of music we will be able to produce and social media is a cost- effective and efficient form of advertising. We will primarily utilize Facebook, but are willing to adapt to other forms of social media in the near future as well.",0,,0,Records

Having that kind of power over my career is exciting!\n\n4. My schedule is flexible.\nThough I may work around the clock during certain times, I do have options. I donג€™t offer sessions on the weekends or on Mondays. And on days when my daughters have an early game out of town, I can be there because I finish up my work at night after they go to bed. In short, I donג€™t need to ask for permission from anyone but myself.\n\n5. I choose the people I work with.\nWhen I worked for someone else, I didnג€™t get a say over who I worked with. Now I surround myself with positive people who give me the confidence and optimism I need to keep moving forward.\n\n6. I donג€™t have to wear pantyhoseג€¦ EVER!\nWhen I worked in outside sales, I had to dress appropriately for whatever business I was visiting that day.","Someone who exercises initiative by organizing a venture to take benefit of an opportunity and, as the decision maker, decides what, how, and how much of a good or service will be produced.\nAn entrepreneur supplies risk capital as a risk taker, and monitors and controls the business activities.

Despite the untimely sickness and death of his father and the severe financial challenges faced by his family, Iris excelled in mathematics and science in high school and received a scholarship to attend STI College at Quezon City, Philippines where he finished a course in electronics and robotics. He later received a certificate in solar energy and advanced photovoltaics from Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, a university considered to be among the world's most prestigious universities in the field of science and engineering.\n\nUpon graduation from college, Iris exposed himself in different industries in Philippines, not to build a career, but rather to understand the society's most pressing social problems and how to address them and come up with an innovative solutions for wide-scale change. He spent majority of his life after college working closely with scientists that conducts research about the particles and forces that shape the natural world and understanding of Earth processes, evaluating and designing alternative energy systems, pollution control and mitigation, natural resource management, and the effects of global climate change. While working, he has held also a variety of leadership positions with The Venus Project Philippines and various non-profit environmental organizations. Dedicated on putting his hands-on on helping his fellow human beings and bringing change about, Iris also currently serves at the Armed forces of the Philippines' 103rd Technical and Administrative Services Group where he received military trainings in urban warfare, and currently participates at urban search and rescue missions, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions.\n\nIn August 2013, Iris took the reins of Nebula Innovations, a for-profit company owned and operated by Dytech Autonetics Co. Ltd., a partnership founded by him and Ms. Jameel Dalusung, a graduate of Bachelor of science in business administration major in Entrepreneurship from Bulacan State University, where they propose a feasible plan of action for social change, one that works towards a peaceful and sustainable global civilization. Their company's proposals outline an alternative to strive toward where human rights are no longer paper proclamations but a way of life. They advocate an alternative vision unlike any other social system that has gone before. Their conclusions are based on years of study and experimental research by many people from various scientific disciplines, a truly straightforward approach to the redesign of our culture, in which the age-old inadequacies of war, poverty, hunger, debt, environmental degradation, and unnecessary human suffering are viewed not only as avoidable, but totally unacceptable.",,,0,Self Employeds

Every time I see millions of children in abject   poverty, those in the middle of crisis, the agony that the abandoned and orphaned children go through, I turn my tears into sacrifices and energies to move mountains.""","Being a child from a well off family, I had everything a child needed for healthy growth. However, all this changed in a blink of an eye when My father, a wealthy businessman then, was kidnapped by soldiers in Soroti District in 1986 while I was two years old, we never saw him again.\n\n\u200b\nHis kidnap was at the peak of the conflict between the soldiers loyal to deposed Ugandan president Tito Okello Lutwa and National Resistance Army (NRA) led by President Yoweri Museveni that captured power in 1986.\n\u200b\nLife changed dramatically as my mother, a state nurse and an in charge at Abim Hospital by then was left stranded and hiding for her life.\n\u200b\nThe demise of my father left the extended family helpless as he was the main source of support for the large family.Relatives scattered everything that remained in his name and the we were left without a roof over our heads.\n\n\u200b\nMy mother was forced to go back to her village as insecurity was at its peak and the rebels were after her thinking she kept part of my father\'s money.\nAlone with six children to fend for without any  help, her family who had all  benefited from her support neglected her in her most wanting situation ,she struggled to feed, dress and send the children to school.\n\nI recall that we depended on boiled bananas for most of our meals and vegetables, I had one pink dress that were even torn but because my mother could not  even afford to buy food for us, a new dress would be an impossibility.\nI have lived to honor the woman who gave birth to me, besides the difficulties, she never gave up, my elder siblings were in high school and my mum struggled to raise tuition for their schools ,we had to forgo everything that needed money as she raised money to send them to school.\nWith her background in nursing, she started a home clinic in one of the grass thatched houses in our compound but because she lacked capital to buy drugs, she operated  on minimum budget.\n\nMy siblings Andrew, Harriet and Jane rode bicycle to their boarding schools which were about 76kms from home and every time my mom visited them in their different schools ,she rode a bicycle for all the distance to and from their schools and carried with her only boiled bananas and  peanut paste with fees balances.\n\nEvery time my mother returned from the school visit, she laid helpless on the floor, my little brother Denis and I sat next to her and looked quietly in pain. We never asked her a single because it was clear that she had gone through hell riding for all that distance. \n""I have died a thousand times, seeing what disadvantaged mothers go through for the sake of their children "".\n\u200b\nBreakthrough\nOur breakthrough came in 1995, when my mother managed to secure UGX 150,000 approx. $43(forty three dollar loan from a village saving group.\nג€My mother injected the money into her limping clinic. With time, the business grew and we were able to get back to our feet again,\n""The years we  lived in abject poverty remains fresh on my mind and this changed my life completely . Every time I see millions of children in abject   poverty, those in the middle of crisis, the agony that the abandoned and orphaned children go through, I turn my tears into sacrifices and energies to move mountains.""\nBesides the difficulties I went through, I grew up a very generous and caring child, it started with the passion of wanting to rescue my mother from poverty and later grew into a force to give hope to the most abject children within my community which expanded to restoring hope to the worldג€™s most vulnerable population.\n\u200b\nWhile in school, I only managed to study on bursaries I earned from being active in sports and academic excellence, i knew I had to do something about my momג€™s situation and the first thing would be to do my best to save her from paying my tuition. Secondly, I needed to work hard to save the children who are suffering in abject poverty within my community.\nBut while in school the conditions of other children haunted me, I distributed almost all my grabs and pocket money to them since by that time my momג€™s clinic had picked up and she was making enough money to feed the family.\n\u200b\nMy academic excellence earned me bursaries for my high school where I emerged among the best students in the whole country at UACE, this also  earned me a government scholarship to study bachelor of laws degree at Makerere university but because of my passion for children, Bachelors in Education was my only best choice and dream so I applied for change of course which was granted hence I perused Education and later on perused bachelor of Science degree in Land surveying. Besides my mother, I attribute my academic success to Mr. wambedde Moses, my Head teacher at St. Lawrence citizens high school-cream Land campus who believed in my potential and made me think that I was the best student in the country.\n\u200b\nBirth of children of Africa\nServing disadvantaged children was always my passion, i felt exactly how painful it was for the children as I remembered how hard it was for me to live in extreme poverty, mocked and discriminate by children from rich families but I did not know that my passion could turn into a huge dream that could put smiles on thousands on faces of children living in unbearable conditions around the world.\n\u200b\nWhen the LRA insurgency was at its peak in 2000,i had started an unregistered organization called children of Africa which supported my poor friends and children who had fled from South Sudan insurgency studying in my school.\n\u200b\nMy dream however came true in 2006 while On a bus to Kampala(Uganda) from Lira District , I  met Mr. Jerry Brown, a British national . Brown and his family were on vacation in Uganda. We struck a friendship on the bus and later had several trips together. One day while visiting Paraa Game Reserve in Nwoya District, we met a group of needy children and i gave all the food stuff that i had packed for my trip to them ,to me this was a usual gesture but Mr. brown and his wife took this very seriously.\nLater Brown and the wife came up with the idea to  legalize my organization and he would help with recourses to get us started and I decided our first move would be to rescue the children affected by LRA war at that time.\n\u200b\n""10 years ago, what began as a dream of a little girl to help children affected by conflict get access to the education, health care and protection they needed to survive the horrors of violence of LRA Insurgency in Northern Uganda grew quickly into series of efforts committed to empowering children to realize their full potential, wherever they live, whatever their dreams are. I am  grateful to work alongside the amazing team of Children Of Africa Uganda around Africa and USA""\n\u200b\nTo date, Children of Africa supports over 135,000 children across Africa with head quarters in United States.\n\u200b",,,0,Socials

ramon,The Kolb Family Fund,260016,"Belmont, MA",http://www.kivafriends.org,US,1164378310,kivaramon.blogspot.com,Sr. Product Manager at Nuance Communications,"We have a close relationship to Latin America. Our general experience with traditional forms of development aid is, that -although necessary for building infrastructure, education, and health care- they often don\'t have the grassroots effect that allows an economy to be built from the bottom up. We believe that someone that has the skills and determination to get ahead should be encouraged to do so in a way that allows this person to thrive. Helping micro-finance small Latin American entrepreneurs is our contribution to exporting the ""American Dream"" of getting ahead by working hard. Is micro-financing the fix-all solution for poverty in developing countries? Should it replace traditional forms of development aid and other economic stimuli like providing titles for property? Definitely not. However, it does provide those that see an opportunity the wherewithal to exploit the opportunity. \r\n\r\nFollowing the example of some other Kiva lenders, we are trying to build up a Latin America focused microfinance family investment fund by investing $25 twice a month into a new business. After a year, we will have $600 invested in micro-businesses that will create a continuous, self-sustaining investment stream as loans get paid off. At that point, we will re-evaluate to see if this investment system works, and if we want to increase our investment base or ""retire"" from it. \r\n\r\n- Proud member of Pondering Pig\'s Kiva Investment Group.

That would allow me then to train, hire, and sub contract out technicians that I have trained.  Cat5 Cabling will grow from a small install, maintenance and repair company, to a training program, temp agency, full service network  and cabling company.  The loan would be used to secure my accountant, lawyer and other business fee's, such as insurance, fuel cost payroll, minority business certification etc. The are also business associations with membership fee's that I would to join such as the Enterprise Center which offers a program for start up businesses.  Financial stability will also provide the opportunity for Cat5 Cabling to bid confidently on larger contracts as a sub contractor with companies such as Comcast, Verizon and local government.  Companies such as Mega Path, provide I.T service and support for all of the major corporations, such as Wal Mart, Target, Foot Locker.  However this company pay thirty days from the day that the invoice is approved.  me being a small business, I can not afford to wait that long for payments.  This is where a loan(financial stability) would assist Cat5 Cabling with cash flow.   Technology is changing everyday, and businesses are consistently upgrading there networks and equipment.  And me as a Entrepreneur I see this as a opportunity to provide a service for a industry that is always growing.","I was born and raised in North Philadelphia by two blue collar parents who were Entrepreneurs at heart and taught me the value of hard work and believing in your self.  I attended college at Saint Augustine College in Raleigh NC.  I studied business, but did not graduate, leaving one semester short of my degree.  I returned home and enrolled in free six months telecommunications course provided by a grant and church program.  I have been working in this industry ever since.  I have always been a Entrepreneur, from selling spinning tops to others kids in the community, to washing cars in high school and selling clothes in college.  I m active in my community as a member of Tioga United, a non profit community organization located in the Tioga section of the city.  My role there is the Youth Coordinator.  We ran a summer program for two summers where I would take ten kids out in to the community and clean and pick weeds and pay them hourly.  In a attempt to teach work ethic and the value of a education.  I m currently engaged with two year old and a baby on the way.  I also have my mother and two step children that care for.  I believe that morals and ethics are things that should have taught to me in school before I got to college from a educational stand point, may make the world a better place.  I live a honest, moral and ethical life, I just would like to help those that I can and reap the rewards of my efforts.  This small loan would be the step I need to overcome the small obstacles that are preventing me and the company from growing.  The training and educational program is what really excites me at this point in my life.  By providing a teenager in high school, or someone out of school looking for a career.  The opportunity to learn a skill set that is in demand all across the world, and not go in to debt doing it.  All things come in time, thank you for reading.",,,0,Telecommunications

And at the same time, the property next to the old seat of the sanctuary that we rented to shelter our large animals was requested back by the owner and we became desperate without having where put our animals, because our shelter is only 25 thousand square meters and does not accommodate our large animals. With this we obtained the support of the ONG ""Nֳ÷cleo Crer Sendo"" in Teresֳ³polis that welcomed us with readiness with much love temporarily. But the situation in the ""Nֳ÷cleo Crer Sendo"" is already this critical, since they already had many animals in the place and with the arrival of the animals of the Santuֳ¡rio das Fadas, the pasture is almost at the end and we are all desperate because the animals very soon will be without grass. With this we urgently need a new land to remove the animals from there as soon as possible, before the pasture ends definitively and the animals go hungry.","My name is Patricia Fittipaldi, I am the founder of the Santuֳ¡rio das Fadas, veterinary, vegan and activist!",,,0,Veterinarians

arthur1543,Arthur,2399351,San Francisco,CA,US,1482257424,www.arthurzein.com,Visual artist,"I have a book ready to be print and published. It is a gift book with a lot of pictures and illustrations. While I was traveling back in 2005 and 2006 I took many pictures across the United States, from different places and landmarks of the country. I never had a chance to show them publicly other then art exhibitions, which are a mix with art and poetry. A lot of people shows interest and inspired me to make it available in a print version. So, since last December I working on a print version of my book and it's now completed! \n\nWhat I would like to do next is to print a sample of the book on Lulu.com. Also I would like to buy a laptop, because it would be a great help to communicate throughout the project. And finally I would like to finish website where anybody can buy a book or a print of my art.\n\nI already completed website with all necessary layouts. All it needs is to pay for hosting and SEO marketing. I want to hire someone who can basically put everything to work. I also consider to collaborate with publishers as they shows interest but I want to be self published first.\n\nThe book has three sections which represents periods of my life in the past 10 years. First section is poetry: \n~ I recently started to write but it was very much a surprise to me. As I love poetry myself I found it's a great way to express one's feelings. Second is a visual art section: \n~ I draw since I was a kid and here I gathered some of my recent abstract works. In the end of the book there are some academic drawings as well. Third section is a photographs from different parts of the United States: \n~ San Francisco, New York, National Parks, Pacific Coast, Rock Mountings and more. It is a series of photographs which keeps memories of the country's beautiful landmarks. \n\nThrough out the book there are many illustrations and notes from the diary, which I kept during that time. So it makes overall experience through out the pages an excitement journey. \n\nThe book will be very interesting for those who loves art and enjoys the beautiful landscapes as well as major landmarks of the United States.","I was born in Europe and moved to United States when I was a teenager. I draw since I was three years old. Later it developed into something bigger and professional as an Architecture.

I certainly agree with the saying - 'An un-examined life is a life un-lived'.\r\n\r\nI am ambitious, but not in the sense of 'getting'. More in the sense of 'being'. Being useful, being effective, being happy with myself, happy with others and happy with simply fulfilling my modest needs.\r\n\r\nI am a member of the Green Party (UK), and preferring the use of education and communication to bring about change, I take an active interest in many subjects.\r\n\r\nI prefer to concentrate my efforts and active participation to actively supporting Anti-Slavery International & The Orangutan Land Trust. I am also a member of Amnesty International.\r\n\r\nI am very excited to begin 2011 in a new direction and I now offer web design & development services to non-profit organisations and charities along with genuine ethical, green and social enterprises.\r\n\r\nI am also studying towards accreditation as a counsellor though this is a very new departure for me. I look forward to being able to help those who would benefit from a sympathetic ear in the future.\r\n\r\nI have found much guidance in Buddhism on the ephemiral nature of 'things' and have found much peace and contentment in simply striving for that which is needed and no more. This in turn, I find, allows me much more time and energy to be spent in pursuit of the making of a contribution in the areas that are of importance to me.\r\n\r\nMuch happier with less, I am very much looking forward to utilising my skills in web development, design and marketing for the benefit of organisations that share my concerns and ethos towards their operations.\r\n\r\nI am currently very interested in adding to my web portfolio so if you are involved in an organisation that may benefit from my skills, please do enquire.

I feel that families who practice yoga, gain much from understanding self care as a family and practicing the mindfulness that is fostered at home. In my programs, I aim at uplifting the therapeutic practice and creating a fun and safe enviornment. I have taught my programs in schools and private groups, such as foster care and welfare organizations.\n\nNEEDS: \nMy recent project was a success as an LLC, however, I wish to bring it to a new chapter as a Non- profit Organization. Doing so I will support  inner city youth and families. I also wish to continue to develop my curriculum, teaming up with yoga studios, public schools and private group communities.\n\nI wish to support causes that bridge non-violent communication, health movement and optimal wellness to our youth and support a more dynamic social learning environment in schools and communities. This environment will be a project that builds awareness around environment and community. Our programs aren't just about moving the body in the practice of yoga, we also provide conscious stress releiveing projects like gardening and bee keeping. Many of our tools we share are to support all ages and social dynamisms. I would love to support equality to all races, genders and LGBTQ communities and build a more beautiful world.","I am a Yoga teacher of 7 years. I discovered yoga after years of professional dance and performing arts. I have always been passionate about the creative process. I love to learn about the environment and healthy solutions to diet, community enrichment and social awareness. Yoga seems to be a practice that allows me a full lense view of my life, and I love to share that process with others. I support social equality and ethical principles in all relationships. It is my hope and practice, to develop new skills that support my own self care, as well as educate and support others on their own unique path.",,,0,Yogas
